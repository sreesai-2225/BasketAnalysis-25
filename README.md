# Market Basket Analysis

### Problem Statement

Grocery Genius: Smart Grocery Shopping Assistant with Basket Analysis.
### Overview
This project focuses on market basket analysis using data sourced from Kaggle. Market basket analysis is a technique used to uncover associations between items purchased together in a transactional dataset.



### What is Market Basket Analysis?

Market basket analysis is a data mining technique used to uncover associations between items purchased together in a transactional dataset. The goal of our project is to analyze customer purchase patterns and identify relationships between products. By understanding these associations, businesses can optimize product placement, promotions, and cross-selling strategies to enhance the customer experience and increase revenue.



### Project Flow 
1. **Import Necessary Dependencies**: Begin by importing the required Python libraries and packages for Market Basket Analysis project.

2. **Loading Data**: Load the transactional dataset containing information about customer purchases.

3. **Data Exploration and Visualization**: Explore and visualize the dataset to gain insights into customer behavior and purchasing patterns.

4. **Data Processing**: Prepare the data for analysis by encoding transactions and transforming it into a suitable format for association rule mining.

5. **Transaction Encoding**: Encode the transaction data to represent the presence or absence of items in each transaction.

6. **Association Rule Mining**: Apply association rule mining algorithms (e.g., Apriori or FP Growth) to discover frequent itemsets and association rules.

7. **Rule Evaluation**: Evaluate the generated rules based on metrics such as support, confidence, and lift to identify meaningful associations between items.

8. **Rule Interpretation**: Interpret the discovered association rules to understand the relationships between products and customer purchasing behavior.

9. **Visualize Results**: Visualize the results of the association rule mining process to communicate insights effectively.

10. **Integration with Streamlit**: Integrate the Market Basket Analysis model with Streamlit to create an interactive web application for exploring and visualizing the results.
